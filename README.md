Diabetes Prediction

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on various health metrics using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database. It employs a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to classify individuals as either at risk or not at risk for diabetes.

The application is built with Flask, providing a simple web interface where users can input key health parameters (like age, BMI, glucose levels) to receive a diabetes prediction. The model is trained on the dataset, and the web app allows easy interaction for real-time predictions.

Technologies Used:

Python (for machine learning)

Flask (for the web app)

Pandas, Scikit-learn (for data manipulation and modeling)

Key Features:

Users input health data.

The model predicts if the individual is likely to have diabetes (based on their health data).

Flask web interface for user interaction.
